# Travis Scott Webpage

Site was created with the intention of being able to show to the fans a little of what happens with the singer pages with videos, news and ticket sales was implemented in order to facilitate access. also i added the Spotify Widgets with the intention to show the new singer's album.

## UX

At first I made a sketch of the site on paper. I created a list of options that could not be left out in a mobile version. So I decided to create separate pages to be able to give the user only one page with the necessary information. The stylization of the site was thought of in the way the singer uses colors in his albums / banners and so on. The News page provides the user with the latest news from the singer. The idea is to update the page daily with important news. The Media page has an image carousel along with the spotify widget. so the user can listen to music while browsing the singer's images. The Tour page has the function of showing the next concerts directing to the local ticket sales website. I opted to put videos on a separate page by the size of the youtube windows and also by the organization. usually when users opt for videos they have the will to watch the image. so all the videos are located on a different page.

## Features
- Tour page: This page was developed with the intention of informing fans of the details of the next concerts. the page is basic and is only intended to take the user to the purchase of tickets
- News: This page gives the user the latest news about the singer. again the page is basic and makes use of the bootstrap grid system and also the use of cards.
- Media: This page   delivery to the user images in carousel and also the last album of songs hosted in spotify.
- Videos:This page delivers to the user clips hosted on the song page on youtube



### Features Left to Implement

   The intention is to eventually implement an online store where the user can buy direct from the site shirts, hats and etc.
